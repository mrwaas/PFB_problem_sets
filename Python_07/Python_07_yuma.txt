Yuma by Shel Silverstein

Yuma loves me,
Yuma cares,
Yuma picks me peaches and pears.
Yuma offers me candy and Cokes,
Yuma listens and laughs at me jokes.
Yuma helps when I get in a fight,
Yuma does all my homework at night.
Yuma misses me,
Yuma cries,
Yuma thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Yuma is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Yuma just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Yuma's hand,
In the darkness where Yuma usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Yuma's gone!
